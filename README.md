Final Project for CS 4824 : Machine Learning

filtered-script.txt contains phrases that are not labeled as knock knock jokes.

nodups-jokes.txt contains knock konck jokes that have no punctuation in them.

starting-words.txt contains a list of 3000 common english words.

the "/data gathering" contains files used to help filer out punctuation out of the knock knock jokes and phrases used in both filtered-script.txt and nodups-jokes.txt.

p1.py uses SequenceMatcher and KNN to find a list of words out of starting-words.txt to start our knock knock joke generator.

p2.py uses the list generated by p1.py to start our joke and with each iteration, adds on a word to our joke.

The length of the joke can be controlled.

New jokes can be generated by removing key words of the current generated knock knock joke out from words.
